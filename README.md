# Office-Automation
Simple powershell scripts to automate the mundane tasks I encounter at the office

Typically run with an execution batch script to allow script specific execution policy rights (Used by the RMM I run to deploy these scripts).
To use, use the example .bat and change the referenced name to the name of your script.
